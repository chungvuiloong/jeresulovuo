I love coding and problem solving.

I am currently improbing my coding via projects.




<!-- ## Whats up world! 👋

### Jere here!!

I am looking for coding opportunities to be a coder in Finland or Europe region. It is simply because I love coding and problem solving.

At the moment, I am studying via Busiess College Helsinki and also online via Xamk, Metroplia and also Laurea for any coding or IT related courses.

I dabble in coding with several projects and hope to work with you coders!!
