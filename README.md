### Jere here!!

I am looking for coding opportunities to be a coder in Finland or Europe region. It is simply because I love coding and problem solving.

Plus I am currently living in Finland.

At the moment, I am studying via Xamk, Metroplia and also Laurea for any coding or IT related courses.

I dabble in coding with several projects and hope to work with you coders!!
